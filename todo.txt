If there are 2 wires that connect between the same pair of nodes, delete one (or just
don't create a wire if the same wire already exists).

Make Wire not be a subclass of component (dont need component type, gh, or gw). Remove
gx, gy, gx2, and gy2 from wire (get these values from startNode and endNode)

How do I change the color of a node/terminal to red when the user moves their mouse
over it?

Add options to hide the terminals of each component type.
    If a user clicks on a resistor, for example, a menu will appear on the left (bottom
    of the left sidebar) and it will have a bunch of options. Add these:
        - Hide terminals (checkbox)
        - Hide all resistor terminals (checkbox) (this will also check the first option)

Add a button at the top to clean up extra nodes/wires (wires that aren't connected
to anything and nodes that are along straight wires that aren't at forks)

buttons for downloading and uploading states/circuits. If the user presses upload and
there are components on the canvas, ask them if they want to save their circuit
